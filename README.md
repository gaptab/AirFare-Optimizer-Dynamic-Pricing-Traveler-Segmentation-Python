**Data Generation**: 
The airfare dataset contains features like distance, booking time, demand factor, seat availability, and seasonality.
The traveler segmentation dataset includes spending per trip, flights per year, loyalty points, and business trip ratio.

**Dynamic Pricing Model**:Uses Gradient Boosting Regression to predict airfares.
Trained using historical booking data and key influencing factors.
Outputs predictions and plots actual vs. predicted fares for model evaluation.

**Traveler Segmentation**:Uses K-Means Clustering to segment travelers based on their behaviors.
Standardizes the data for optimal clustering.
Plots clusters to visualize different traveler groups.



**Business Impact**:

**Optimized Pricing Strategy** → Helps airlines adjust ticket prices dynamically based on demand and customer behavior.

**Improved Market Share** → The segmentation model enables targeted promotions, increasing customer retention and revenue.

**Data-Driven Decision Making** → Empowers airlines to personalize offers and maximize profitability.
